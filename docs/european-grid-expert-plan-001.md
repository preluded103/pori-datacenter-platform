# European Grid Intelligence Expert Plan - Fingrid Transmission Network Analysis
Date: 2025-01-22

## Analysis

### Project Requirements Summary
- **Site**: Konepajanranta, Pori, Finland (14km from transmission infrastructure)
- **Power Requirements**: 70MW Phase 1 → 500MW ultimate
- **Local Constraint**: Pori Energia 20kV limited to 65 MVA
- **Critical Need**: Transmission-level connection analysis for >65 MVA loads

### Finnish Transmission Network Architecture
**Fingrid Oyj** operates Finland's transmission system with three voltage levels:
- **400kV**: Main transmission backbone (North-South interconnections)
- **220kV**: Regional transmission network 
- **110kV**: Sub-transmission (connection point for large industrial loads)

### SW Finland Transmission Infrastructure Assessment

#### Primary Transmission Corridors Near Pori
1. **400kV Backbone**: 
   - Olkiluoto Nuclear Plant → Huittinen → Tampere corridor (30km east of Pori)
   - Critical for system stability and capacity
2. **220kV Regional Network**:
   - Pori → Rauma → Turku coastal corridor
   - Pori → Kankaanpää → Seinäjoki inland connection
3. **110kV Sub-transmission**:
   - Multiple circuits serving Pori industrial area
   - Direct connection points for large loads

### Data Source Assessment

#### Confirmed Accessible Sources
1. **Fingrid Open Data Portal** (data.fingrid.fi):
   - Market and operational data available
   - Real-time system status
   - **Limitation**: Infrastructure maps not in public portal

2. **OpenStreetMap Finland** (Verified accessible):
   - Power infrastructure tagged with voltage levels
   - Substation locations with approximate coordinates
   - Power line routes with high accuracy

3. **ENTSO-E Transparency Platform**:
   - Finnish system data integration
   - Cross-border flow information
   - Adequacy assessments for Nordic region

#### Critical Gap Analysis
**Missing Infrastructure Data**:
- Detailed substation capacities and available connection points
- Real-time loading on 110kV circuits serving Pori
- Planned reinforcement projects and timelines
- Connection standards and technical requirements

### Technical Requirements Analysis

#### Fingrid Grid Code Compliance (Based on Finnish standards)
1. **Connection Requirements for 70-500MW**:
   - Mandatory transmission connection (>30MW typically requires 110kV+)
   - Dynamic reactive compensation required
   - Power quality standards (THD, voltage variations)
   - Frequency response capability mandatory

2. **Connection Process Analysis**:
   - **Preliminary Study**: 6-12 weeks (grid impact assessment)
   - **Connection Agreement**: 6-12 months (detailed engineering)
   - **Construction Timeline**: 18-60 months (depending on reinforcement needs)

3. **Distance Impact Assessment**:
   - 14km from transmission infrastructure = significant CAPEX impact
   - Dedicated 110kV line required (€200-400k/km typical)
   - Substation construction needed at site

### Regional Grid Capacity Constraints

#### Seasonal Variations in SW Finland
1. **Summer Period** (May-September):
   - Lower heating demand = higher available capacity
   - Maintenance season = potential temporary constraints
   - Optimal time for large connection commissioning

2. **Winter Period** (November-March):
   - Peak heating demand from district heating loads
   - Higher system loading, reduced available capacity
   - Critical period for grid stability assessment

#### Load Growth Accommodation
- SW Finland seeing increased industrial electrification
- Port of Pori expansion increasing regional demand
- Competition for available transmission capacity

## Recommendations

### 1. Multi-Source Data Integration Approach
**Primary Strategy**: Combine multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis
- **OpenStreetMap**: Infrastructure mapping and preliminary routing
- **Fingrid APIs**: System loading and operational constraints
- **ENTSO-E Data**: Regional adequacy and interconnection flows
- **Direct Contact**: Fingrid Grid Planning Department for specific project data

### 2. Phased Technical Analysis
**Phase 1**: Desktop analysis with available open data
- Map transmission infrastructure within 20km radius
- Identify potential connection points and routes
- Assess seasonal loading patterns from Fingrid data

**Phase 2**: Direct engagement with Fingrid
- Submit preliminary connection inquiry
- Request grid impact study for 70MW Phase 1
- Obtain reinforcement timeline and cost estimates

### 3. Alternative Connection Scenarios
**Scenario A**: Direct 110kV connection (preferred)
- Dedicated line from nearest 110kV substation
- Estimated 14km route requiring corridor acquisition
- Timeline: 24-36 months, Cost: €4-8M

**Scenario B**: 220kV connection for future capacity
- Future-proofing for 500MW ultimate capacity
- Higher initial investment but better long-term economics
- Timeline: 36-48 months, Cost: €8-15M

**Scenario C**: Hybrid approach with energy storage
- Smaller transmission connection with battery storage
- Peak shaving to reduce grid infrastructure requirements
- Timeline: 18-24 months, Cost: €6-12M total

### 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies
**Grid Reinforcement Dependencies**:
- Monitor Fingrid's 10-year grid development plan
- Coordinate with other industrial developments in region
- Secure connection agreement early in development process

**Regulatory Compliance**:
- Engage early with Finnish Energy Authority
