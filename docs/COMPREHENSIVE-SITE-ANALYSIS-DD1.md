## CONCLUSION: ENGINEERING GRADE ASSESSMENT

### BOTTOM LINE: VIABLE BUT HIGH-RISK, HIGH-COST DEVELOPMENT

The Konepajanranta datacenter site presents a technically feasible but significantly constrained development opportunity. The marketing materials substantially understate the engineering challenges, environmental complexity, and infrastructure investment requirements.

### KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY:

1. **Power Infrastructure**: Claims accurate but incomplete - 70MW requires dual connections, 500MW needs transmission backbone expansion
2. **Environmental Impact**: Major constraints from IBA designation, river ecosystem, downtown acoustic limits
3. **Timeline Reality**: 36-60 months vs claimed 18 months, driven by environmental permitting
4. **Investment Scale**: €50-85M infrastructure vs implied minimal investment
5. **Municipal Complexity**: Downtown location increases regulatory scrutiny and community engagement

### RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH COMPREHENSIVE DUE DILIGENCE

**Phase 1 (70MW): CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED**
- Solid technical foundation with identified solutions
- Manageable environmental challenges with proper investment
- Strong economic fundamentals in Finnish market
- Risk mitigation strategies available

**Phase 2+ (200-500MW): HIGH RISK**
- Requires infrastructure development not currently planned
- Environmental impact assessment challenges at scale
- Community acceptance uncertain
- Alternative sites may prove superior for expansion phases

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**
1. Commission detailed power capacity study (Pori Energia/Fingrid)
2. Initiate environmental baseline studies and EIA planning
3. Engage municipal stakeholders for preliminary feedback
4. Develop alternative site contingency plans
5. Secure €100M+ development capital for realistic infrastructure requirements

This analysis provides the engineering-grade due diligence foundation required for informed investment decision-making on the Konepajanranta datacenter opportunity.
