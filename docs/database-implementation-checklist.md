# Database Implementation Checklist

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Supabase Project Setup
- [ ] Create new Supabase project with PostGIS enabled
- [ ] Configure environment variables in your application
- [ ] Enable required extensions: `postgis`, `pg_stat_statements`, `pg_cron`
- [ ] Set up database connection with proper connection pooling

### 2. Schema Creation Priority Order
Execute these SQL scripts in order:

**Step 1: Basic Structure**
```sql
-- Create schemas
CREATE SCHEMA tenant_core;
CREATE SCHEMA shared_reference;  
CREATE SCHEMA system_admin;

-- Enable PostGIS
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```

**Step 2: Core Tables**
- Execute organizations and users tables first
- Set up basic RLS policies for tenant isolation
- Create audit logging framework

**Step 3: Spatial Infrastructure**
- Create constraint layers and infrastructure tables
- Set up spatial indexes and European CRS definitions
- Implement spatial query functions

### 3. Critical Configuration Steps

**Row Level Security Setup:**
```sql
-- Must be executed after table creation
ALTER TABLE tenant_core.organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tenant_core.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tenant_core.projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Performance Indexes (Create Concurrently):**
```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_projects_tenant_active 
    ON tenant_core.projects (tenant_id, is_active) 
    WHERE is_active = TRUE;
```

### 4. Migration from Current Pori Analysis

**Data Preparation:**
- [ ] Export current project coordinates and boundaries
- [ ] Identify existing constraint analysis results
- [ ] Prepare site analysis data in migration format
- [ ] Validate coordinate systems (likely EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3067 for Finland)

**Migration Execution:**
- [ ] Create first tenant account for your organization
- [ ] Import Pori project as baseline case study
- [ ] Validate spatial data integrity
- [ ] Test constraint analysis functions

## Testing & Validation Checklist

### Spatial Data Validation
- [ ] Verify coordinate system transformations are accurate
- [ ] Test spatial intersection queries with real data
- [ ] Validate constraint layer overlaps produce expected results
- [ ] Confirm geometry validity after import

### Multi-Tenant Isolation Testing
- [ ] Create test tenant accounts
- [ ] Verify RLS policies prevent cross-tenant data access
- [ ] Test user role permissions work correctly
- [ ] Confirm audit logging captures all data changes

### Performance Validation  
- [ ] Test query performance with realistic dataset sizes
- [ ] Verify spatial indexes are being used (check query plans)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during large spatial operations
- [ ] Test concurrent user access patterns

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Security Configuration
- [ ] Enable all RLS policies in production
- [ ] Configure JWT authentication with proper secret rotation
- [ ] Set up audit logging for all sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement backup encryption and access controls

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Set up alerting for slow queries (>5 seconds)
- [ ] Monitor database connection pool usage
- [ ] Track spatial query performance metrics

### Data Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Configure automated daily backups
- [ ] Test point-in-time recovery procedures
- [ ] Set up cross-region backup replication
- [ ] Document disaster recovery procedures

## Key Files for Implementation

**Database Schema Files:**
- `/docs/database-architecture-plan.md` - Complete architecture specification
- Create: `/sql/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` - Core table creation
- Create: `/sql/migrations/002_spatial_setup.sql` - PostGIS configuration
- Create: `/sql/migrations/003_rls_policies.sql` - Security policies
- Create: `/sql/functions/spatial_analysis.sql` - Analysis functions

**Application Integration:**
- Update Supabase client configuration with new schema
- Implement tenant context middleware
- Add spatial query helper functions
- Create database connection health checks

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Common PostGIS Issues
**Problem:** Coordinate system transformation errors
**Solution:** Always validate CRS before spatial operations, use ST_Transform() explicitly

**Problem:** Slow spatial intersection queries
**Solution:** Ensure proper spatial indexes, consider ST_DWithin() for proximity queries

### Multi-Tenant Challenges  
**Problem:** RLS policies not blocking cross-tenant access
**Solution:** Test policies thoroughly, use SECURITY DEFINER functions for complex logic

**Problem:** Performance degradation with tenant isolation
**Solution:** Optimize indexes for tenant_id + other frequently queried columns

### Migration Challenges
**Problem:** Geometry validation failures during import
**Solution:** Use ST_MakeValid() and ST_Buffer(geom, 0) to clean geometries

**Problem:** Large dataset migration timeouts
**Solution:** Batch insert operations, use COPY for bulk data loading

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
- All spatial queries complete in < 5 seconds for standard operations
- Multi-tenant data isolation passes security audit
- Database can handle 50+ concurrent users without performance degradation
- Backup and recovery procedures complete within defined RTO/RPO targets

### Business Success Metrics
- Pori project data successfully migrated and accessible
- Constraint analysis produces same results as current file-based system
- User authentication and authorization working for multiple client organizations  
- Professional compliance tracking meets RICS/EN 50600 requirements

## Technical Debt & Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Implement real-time constraint layer updates via webhooks
- Add machine learning-based site scoring algorithms
- Create automated report generation with professional templates
- Implement advanced spatial analytics (viewshed, accessibility analysis)

### Performance Optimizations
- Consider partitioning large tables by tenant_id or date ranges
- Implement materialized view refresh strategies
- Add query result caching for frequent constraint checks
- Optimize spatial query execution plans

This checklist provides a structured approach to implementing the comprehensive database architecture while maintaining professional standards and ensuring scalability for the European datacenter due diligence market.
