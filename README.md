# Datacenter Pre-DD Intelligence Platform

## üéØ Mission Statement

Transform datacenter site selection from expensive, time-intensive full due diligence to intelligent Phase 0 screening that identifies viable candidates for detailed investment.

**Value Proposition**: Screen 20 sites in 4-8 weeks to identify 3-5 candidates worthy of ‚Ç¨150-500k full DD investment.

## üìä Platform Overview

### Phase 0 Scope (What We Built)
- ‚úÖ **High-level site constraints identification**
- ‚úÖ **Desktop analysis of publicly available data**
- ‚úÖ **Go/No-Go decision support**
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure proximity analysis** (distance only)
- ‚úÖ **Regulatory requirement flagging** (not detailed analysis)
- ‚úÖ **Order-of-magnitude cost indicators**
- ‚úÖ **Professional scorecard generation**

### NOT in Scope (Future Phases)
- ‚ùå Detailed engineering calculations
- ‚ùå Site visits or field investigations
- ‚ùå Professional engineer sign-off
- ‚ùå Precise cost estimates
- ‚ùå Final investment-grade reports

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components Built

1. **Database Schema** (`/core/database/schema.sql`)
   - Multi-tenant PostGIS architecture
   - European coordinate systems support
   - Audit trails and compliance tracking
   - Resource list management for learned data sources

2. **Proximity Analysis Engine** (`/modules/proximity/infrastructure-analysis.ts`)
   - Power infrastructure distance analysis
   - Fiber connectivity assessment
   - Water source proximity
   - Transportation access evaluation
   - Risk level flagging system

3. **Scoring Algorithm** (`/core/analysis/scoring-algorithm.ts`)
   - Weighted scoring across 5 dimensions
   - Go/No-Go recommendation logic
   - Site ranking and comparison
   - Confidence assessment based on data quality

4. **Professional Scorecard** (`/core/reporting/scorecard-template.tsx`)

### Modular Risk Flagging Architecture

Each risk module follows the same pattern:
- **Input**: Site coordinates + boundary
- **Process**: Proximity/zone analysis (NOT engineering calculations)
- **Output**: Risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) + specific flags

**Risk Modules** (Templates Created):
- **Seismic**: Zone identification (not PGA calculations)
- **Flood**: Flood zone mapping (not modeling)
- **Geotechnical**: Soil type flags (not bearing capacity)
- **Aviation**: Airport proximity (not obstruction analysis)
- **Heritage**: Protected site distance (not impact studies)
- **EMI**: Transmitter proximity (not interference modeling)

## üìà Proven Success Pattern

### Reference Implementation: Pori, Finland
Our Finnish datacenter analysis demonstrates the platform's capability:

- **Delivered**: Phase 1+ quality analysis (worth ‚Ç¨150-500k)
- **Scope**: Full technical feasibility with grid analysis, environmental permits, municipal engagement
- **Data Sources Validated**: 
  - ‚úÖ Maanmittauslaitos (property boundaries)
  - ‚úÖ SYKE (environmental data)
  - ‚úÖ Pori Planning (zoning via WFS)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Power grid (ENTSO-E + OSM hybrid approach)

### Platform Extraction
The Pori success proves our analytical methodology. The platform scales this approach:

**From Pori (3-5 weeks detailed analysis):**
- Detailed power flow modeling
- Comprehensive regulatory timeline analysis
- Municipal stakeholder mapping

**To Platform (3-5 days screening):**
- Infrastructure proximity flagging
- Regulatory requirement identification
- Risk level assessment with Go/No-Go

## üéØ Business Model

### Target Market
- **Primary**: Datacenter developers and institutional investors
- **Use Case**: Multi-site screening before full DD investment
- **Value**: Save ‚Ç¨2-5M by avoiding unnecessary full DD on unsuitable sites

### Pricing Strategy
- **Per Site**: ‚Ç¨15-25k for Phase 0 assessment
- **Batch Discounts**: Volume pricing for 10+ sites
- **Speed**: 3-5 days per site analysis
- **Output**: Professional scorecard + risk flagging

### ROI Calculation
**Client scenario**: 20 potential sites, budget for 3-5 full DD studies
- **Without Platform**: ‚Ç¨3-10M on full DD for all sites
- **With Platform**: ‚Ç¨300-500k screening + ‚Ç¨450-2.5M DD for top candidates
- **Savings**: ‚Ç¨2-7.5M + faster decision making

## üåç European Expansion Strategy

### Generic Modular Architecture
The platform uses configuration-driven country expansion:

```
/country-configs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ finland/ (proven reference implementation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ norway/ (next target)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sweden/ (Nordic expansion)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template/ (for new countries)
```

### Data Source Strategy
1. **National Level**: Mapping agencies, environmental ministries
2. **Municipal Level**: Planning departments, WFS services
3. **Fallbacks**: OpenStreetMap, commercial providers

### Success Metrics
- **New Country Setup**: <1 day configuration time
- **Code Reusability**: 95%+ shared across countries
- **Zero Code Changes**: New countries via config only
